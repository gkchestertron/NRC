This is a front-end CMS system I am building on rails, bootstrap and backbone. It allows the admin user to simply click and edit any content on any page. It will require html layouts provided for the end client, but it will make updating their content very simple and straightforward while not allowing them to make their site look too ugly or unprofessional.
